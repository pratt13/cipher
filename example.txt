Dear Miss Piggy,
I hope this letter finds you basking in the spotlight, as you so rightfully deserve. It's been a little while since we've shared the stage, and the theater feels a tad quieter without your grand presence.

I've been spending my days by the old lily pad, strumming my banjo and reflecting on our countless adventures. It's funny how the simplest songs can bring back the most vivid memories of us. Whether it's the thrill of the show or the quiet moments behind the curtains, each note seems to echo with laughter and a touch of your unique charm.

I must admit, I miss the excitement that follows you like a spotlight. The way you command attention and turn every scene into a showstopper is something truly special. You've always been the star, Piggy, and I'm just grateful to be part of your cast.

So, here's a little ditty I wrote for you:

🎵 Oh, Miss Piggy, you're the diva of my heart,
With every "Hi-ya!" you turn life into art.
Your glamour and your grace, they shine so bright,
They make even the gloomiest days seem light. 🎵

I'm looking forward to our next rendezvous under the stage lights. Until then, keep shining, my dear, for the world is your stage, and you are its brightest star.

With affection and admiration,

Kermit 🐸
